What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

  In Project One, the primary problem was efficiently managing and retrieving course data using various structures such as Vectors, Hash Tables, and Trees. The objective was to evaluate the time complexity and grasp the pros and cons of each structure. In Project Two, the problem was organizing and displaying course information from a provided dataset containing elements like course numbers, names, and prerequisites.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

  For both projects, the initial step was comprehending the needs and  choosing appropriate data structures. Data structures are vital for efficiently organizing and manipulating data. For instance, Vectors were straightforward yet limited for searches, while Hash Tables provided faster lookup times. This knowledge helped me make informed selections based on each project's specific requirements.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

  The main obstacles involved debugging and confirming the selected structures functioned as intended. Leveraging debugging tools, online help, and course materials assisted in overcoming these challenges. For example, in Project Two, there was an issue of duplicated courses when reloading the data structure, which was resolved by clearing the existing vector before reading new data.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

  This project emphasized the importance of choosing optimal data structures and algorithms for each problem. I realized the right structure can significantly improve efficiency. It also stressed thoroughly testing to verify the methods I select are truly the best fit.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  Working on these projects has enhanced my coding practices regarding writing clean, commented, modular code. For maintainability, I've learned the value of useful comments and grouping related functions together. This facilitates updating or modifying the code later on.
